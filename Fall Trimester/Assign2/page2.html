<h1> After Photoshop </h1>

<hr>

<p> <h3> After Image: </h3> </p>

<h3> The Changes Made: </h3>
</p>

<p>Although they might be small, you will find that several aspects of this photo differ from the original one. One of the clouds in the sky, rather conspicuously, has turned a dark shade of grey (it's a rain cloud now!). As well, there are now three orange sandbags in the back of the soccer goal - the middle one is a clone of the bag on the right. Off in the distance, you might notice that there are now two clock towers, completely in sync with each other. Finally, I have cloned the American flag pole and, if you look very closely, the side of Fisher Hall now has a sign reading Horace Mann School on it.

<p> <h3> Photoshop Algorithm: </h3> </p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Take a photo from my phone and upload its jpg to photoshop.</li>
<li>Add a <b>text box</b> that reads &quot;Horace Mann School&quot;, and place it on the side of Fisher Hall. </li>
<li>Use the <b>eyedropper tool</b> to select the red color of one of the sandbags in goal and apply it to the text box.</li>
<li>Use the <b>magnetic lasso tool</b> to select the shape of the cloud on the far left. </li>
<li>Use the <b>paint bucket</b> to change the color of the selected cloud to grey.</li>
<li>Use the <b>clone stamp</b> to create a copy of the sandbag on the right and place it in the middle of the goal.</li>
<li>Also use the <b>clone stamp</b> to copy the american flag pole and place it to the left of the original.</li>
<li>Finally, use the <b>clone stamp</b> to duplicate the clock tower on top of Fisher Hall; place the copy on top of Phorzheimer Hall.</li>
